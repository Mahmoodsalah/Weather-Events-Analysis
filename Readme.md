## Overview



In this report we aim to describe/analyze  the impact of different weather events on public health and economy based on the storm database collected from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) from 1950 - 2011. We will use the estimates of fatalities, injuries, property and crop damage to decide which types of event are most harmful to the population health and economy.From these data, we found that "**TORNADO**" , "**EXCESSIVE HEAT**" and "**TSTM WIND**" are most harmful with respect to population health, while "**FLOOD**", "**HURRICANE/TYPHOON**"" and "**TORNADO**"" have the greatest economic consequences.
